await followService.notifyFollowersOfNewEvent(
  organizerId,
  eventId,
  eventTitle
);
```

### 2. Event Updates
When an event is updated, notify followers:

```tsx
// In your event update logic
await followService.notifyFollowersOfEventUpdate(
  organizerId,
  eventId,
  eventTitle,
  'Date changed to July 15th'
);
```
